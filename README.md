# VirtualLibrary

## Description
Virtual Library is a Windows Form application created in order to let users take or return books by themselves. 

## Functionality
* User can make himself an account in which he gives information such as "username", "surname", "name", "email", creates passwords and takes a portrait picture. 
* User can log in using his "username" or by showing his face (application detects and recognizes the user). 
* User can scan a book and choose to either take it or return it (once he is logged in). 
* User can see the information on what books he has already taken and the dates on when to return them (once he is logged in).
